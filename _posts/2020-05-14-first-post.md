I was inspired by reading [Life is a Marathon: A Memoir of Love and Endurance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40697108-life-is-a-marathon) by Matt Fitxgerald. The book made me remember that the best marathoners in the world are between 30 and 40 years old. That means that I have about 3 years of prime marathon running left to me (hopefully more). But I have always imagined that my best marathon has yet to come. These two ideas - the prime years for peak marathon performance and my own anticipation of running a great marathon - led me to create a completely unrealistic and audacious goal for myself. I want to run a 3 hour marathon. This is really, really absurd and will entail shaving 37 minutes off my most recent marathon performance.

I'm not sure how to reach this goal, yet. But I think setting the goal is the first step. The second step is holding myself accountable for its completion, which is what this blog is about (also I thought it'd be fun to deploy a Jekyll blog w/ AWS). I may need to engage a personal running coach in the days to come. But, my hope is that keeping a public training log will have 80% of the benefit at < 20% of the cost of a coach.

I am not yet sure where this challenge will take me. But I'm excited for the journey.

## Notes

This was my first run longer than 7 miles since quarantine started. I think I felt good throughout - definitely wanted it to be over with a mile or two left. I got a bit lost and ended up way further east than I had intended, which probably slowed me down a bit. But it just meant I could end the route earlier than I had planned. After the run I felt pretty fatigued and sleepy. Very sleepy. Before the run, I went to work on my legs with my hypervolt.

## Run Summary

## Notes

After a rest day yesterday (following a six day, 49 mile streak), I returned for some nice recovery miles. I felt pretty tired at the start, but once I got going, my 3 hour goal motivated me to keep pushing myself. I didn't check my pace at all while running, but just went off my perceived effort. With .5 miles left, I stopped to do some additional body weight exercises.

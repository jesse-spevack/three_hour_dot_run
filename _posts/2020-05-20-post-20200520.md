## Notes

Today training started for real. This is my first Run4PRs workout - a warmup, two mile time trial and cool down. I went longer than the prescribed 1 mile warm up to try to get some extra miles. I was pretty deliberate about running at a very slow pace - though looking back a few weeks a lot of my [runs](https://www.strava.com/activities/3436461618) were at this pace. I then did two miles hard on a track at the local high school. I had the track to myself, which was nice. I focused on starting at a conservative pace and keeping my breath under control. Once I got to mile two I picked it up a bit and then progressively picked it up each lap. I tried to focus on appreciating the moment. The final lap was my fastest. I was pretty winded at the end as I ended in a full sprint. I walked for a few blocks and then did a two mile cooldown.

While running two miles at a 7:17 avg pace didn't feel like my absolute best, it's crazy to think about how much I'm going to have to work to do 26.2 miles at a 6:50 pace

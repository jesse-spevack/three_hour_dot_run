## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|

## Notes

I ran along the Highline Canal Trail which is my favorite place to run in Denver. The effort felt pretty consistent throughout the run. I felt great. This is definitely faster than I have run alone in the past when I go this long. I've lost about 10 pounds over the last month and a half or so and I think being at a lighter weight really helps. I find I have more energy and can run faster with the same perceived effort. Still feeling strong, but I know I have a long way to go.

I want to just record that I have a blister on my right big toe. This was from yesterday's run. I just put some medical tape over it and it did not bother me at all during today's long run.

Tomorrow is a rest day and looking ahead to next week I have some new and tough workouts ahead of me.

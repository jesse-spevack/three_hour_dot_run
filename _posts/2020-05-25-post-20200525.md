## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  5.00 mi   | 47:42                  |  8:51 / mi  |

## Notes

These were supposed to be easy miles, but I might have run them on the fast side. I think the decrease in volume over the last week as I work to build up my base in this new training plan has left me feeling antsy to run. That plus my ridiculous 3 hour marathon goal has just made me want to run fast.

The workout ended with four 20 second strides followed by 90 second jogging recovery, just like the last easy run. Tomorrow is a tempo run and strength work, plus it's a work day so that will definitely be a test. I'm going to work on keeping hydrated and getting sleep tonight.

I forgot to take photos at the end of my run, so I just took photos of myself while walking with my kids along the end of my run route.

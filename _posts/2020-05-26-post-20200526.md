## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  7.04 mi   | 1:06:06                |  9:23 / mi  |

## Notes

This one was really tough. I did a two mile warm up at an easy pace then did two minutes on and two minutes off 8 times. I was able to keep it under my goal of 6:50 for all but the last repeat, which is dissapointing. But, I really was gassed. This is where things start to feel real. It's incredible to imagine that my two minute repeat pace I'm going to hold for three hours. Big ridiculous goals.

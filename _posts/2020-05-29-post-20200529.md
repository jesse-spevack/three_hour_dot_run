## Notes

It felt great to run today after yesterday's rest. It was tough to get the speeds consistent through each mile progression. I think I started the miles fast and then slowed down to try to stay in the correct pacing window. Also, my garmin was buzzing at me because I used the workout feature, so it alerted me everytime I moved into or out of my target pace range. I think I'll forgoe the trouble of this feature in future workouts, it was a hassle to setup and just distracted me from running.

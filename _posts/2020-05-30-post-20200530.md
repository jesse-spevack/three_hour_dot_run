## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 10.03 mi   | 1:31:25                |  9:07 / mi  |

## Notes

I wanted my last mile to be my fastest mile going into this run. So I went out at what felt like a pretty conservative pace. I tried to pick it up each mile. I love the Highline Canal Trial.

After the run I did some pushups and lunges.

## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  6.08 mi   |   54:49                |  9:01 / mi  |

## Notes

I felt strong on this run. I could have been more consistent though. After the first mile went a bit quicker than I had planned I dialed it back on mile two, but my watch was in overall average time, not lap time. As a result I thought I was going slower than my watch pace showed. Oh well! Fun run, but it was getting hot out there. I did the strides a bit earlier to try to maximize flat elevation stride time.

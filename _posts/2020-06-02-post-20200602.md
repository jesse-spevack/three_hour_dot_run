## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  8.58 mi   |  1:18:19               |  9:07 / mi  |

## Notes

This one was pretty tough. I think I probably did the first of the three tempo miles too fast as the second two got progressively slower. As this training continues I'll start to be more realistic with my pacing. Two of the miles I hit the 6:50-7:10 pace called for by the workout. The third and final mile I came in at 7:11. Pretty hot weather and I tried to get an earlier start. As these workouts continue and the tempertaure increases I'm going to have so start running earlier.

## Notes

Legs were pretty sore this morning I think because I did a bunch of lunges yesterday. I actually thought today was going to be a rest day, but when I looked at the training plan - surprise! Before heading out I used my hypervolt to try to beat my legs a bit. When I went out I told myself to keep it easy and aim for somewhere between 9:30 and a 10 min pace. I went out in the 9:30s and felt progressively better as the run went on. So I picked it up. Legs felt better after the run, but definitely still some soreness.

## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  8.25 mi   |  1:15:06               |  9:06 / mi  |

## Notes

This one felt good - I wanted to go out somewhere between 9:30 and 10. The fast side of that range felt maintainable and even easy. When my wached buzzed for mile 5 I was surprised and had no time to think. So I just picked it up and aimed for the top of the pace range called for by the workout. I held 8:30 easily for the two miles and decided to pick it up in the final mile.

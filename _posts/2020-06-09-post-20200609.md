## Notes

I ran later in the day because it was raining this morning. So that means I had some food before I ran.

The workout was 1 mile warm-up followed by 5 miles at 7:20-7:40 and finish off with a 1 mile cool down.

This one was tough. I thought the 7:40 pace would feel more comfortable and I'd be able to speed it up to closer to 7:30 for the last two miles. But the second to last mile of the steady state section of the workout had a pretty big uphill. Still, got to get faster.

I'm writing this a few hours after the workout and I definitely feel some tenderness in my legs. It feels like I put them through a workout.

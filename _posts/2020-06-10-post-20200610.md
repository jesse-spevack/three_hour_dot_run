## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  6.04 mi   |    52:52               |  8:45 / mi  |

## Notes

I was worried that'd I'd be tired from the previous day's tough steady state run, but I felt great and tried to run a strong pace. This is much faster than I've run this route or workout in the past. I need to pay attention to my body and make sure that I'm not doing too much too soon.

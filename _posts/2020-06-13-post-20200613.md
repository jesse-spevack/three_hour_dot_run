## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  6.07 mi   |    53:30               |  8:49 / mi  |

## Notes

Kept it below 9:00 the entire run. Is this the new normal? Looking back at my plan, this was supposed to be 5 miles. I'm going to try to keep this or better as my easy pace.

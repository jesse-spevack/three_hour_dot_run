## Notes

I decided to do the speed work on the local track today to save some drive time. It got pretty warm out there. I'm pretty happy with this workout. I definitely pushed hard and my splits were all within a few seconds of each other. The good news is that I did a similar workout to this two weeks ago and I beat myself by about 5 seconds per mile. And that previous workout only had 3 repeats. Though, it was on a gravel path, not a track. Still, progress for sure.

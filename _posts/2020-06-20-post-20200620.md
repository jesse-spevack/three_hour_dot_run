## Notes

This was a nice 12 mile run. I really like this route. At 5.5 miles a high school cross country team pulled up next to me. It was fun running with the kids, though quickly they left me in the dust. I tried to go out conservative and then finish fast. I felt strong throughout the run. I brought water with me in my camelbak.

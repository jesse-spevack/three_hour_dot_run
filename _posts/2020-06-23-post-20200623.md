## Notes

I tried to really keep it easy on the warm up, which I didn on the track. As for the fartleks, they were very hard. The goal was 6:25-6:40 pace which I was not able to manage. The first rep I hit 6:37, but after that everything was 6:46-6:55. Also I messed up on my second rep, I did 2 minutes at 6:34. I looked at my watch, saw the 2 zeros and went into recovery mode. I realized I made a mistake in the third rep when things felt so much harder. So that was disheartening, but I stuck with it and got the 8 full reps in plus the bonus little screw up rep. I really tried not to give up and keep pushing each rep even though I wasn't hitting the 6:40 goal. Again, disheartening, but next time I'll do better.

I really need to get out earlier for these and sleep at least 1 hour more. I think that would help a lot.

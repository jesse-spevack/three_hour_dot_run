## Notes

I'm very upset about this run. I ran out onto 6th Ave, looked up, saw a car coming a bit closer than I was expecting, so I stopped short. In so doing I rolled my ankle. It hurt pretty bad, but the first thing that went through my mind was that this was going to put me behind on my training. I took the rest of the run more gingerly than normal. It was also hotter than normal, so that might have slowed me down too.

After I showered I put some ice on my ankle for about 30 minutes. After that I put on a compression sock.

A few hours later and I definitely feel some stiffness and soreness. I'm hoping I'm back to normal tomorrow, but it might take a few days.

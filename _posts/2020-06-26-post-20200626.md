## Notes

My ankle felt good enough this morning to make me feel comfortable doing the 7 miles on my plan. It was not feeling perfect and felt a little tender at around the end of mile 5. Still, enjoyed getting out there. I'm assuming ankle will be totally fine for tomorrows run.

Looking back, the last time I did this run was May 19. I was 30 seconds slower per mile. And I wasn't pushing it at all on today's run, if anything I was taking it pretty easy. So I think this is another indicator for what I already knew, even with a slightly tender ankle, I'm way faster than I was 30 days ago.

I've got to focus on how far I've come and not how far I have yet to go.

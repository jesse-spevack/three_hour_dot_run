## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
|  9.15 mi   |    1:18:49             |  8:37 / mi  |

## Notes

My ankle felt 100% for this run. Though my left knee (opposite leg from ankle roll) had a twinge of something outside bottom. I've had this pain before, but I didn't feel it at all while I was running.

The run was great. I saw Eri and Brian separately from the Runners Edge group.

I was happy with my pace as well. I never felt like I was pushing, it felt relaxed and strong.

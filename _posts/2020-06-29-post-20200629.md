## Notes

Legs felt heavy for the first four miles. It was hard to get them moving as fast as I wanted them to go.

The strides felt good and my legs felt a bit more ready to go after the four repeats.

I'm going to start adding temperature in my log to see if it actually is affecting my results as much as I think it is.

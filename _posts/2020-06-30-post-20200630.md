## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        | Temp  |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|  8.25 mi   |   1:11:49              |  8:42 / mi  |  65   |

## Notes

I went to sleep a little earlier than normal, a bit before 10. I got out a bit earlier than normal, 7:24 am. That was great for the temperature. This was definitely a tough workout: 2 mile warm up, 1.5 mile tempo, .25 mile recovery, and then another 1.5 mile tempo run, finishing up with a cool down run. The tempo portion was definitely tough. The first rep I averaged a 7:28 pace (first mile was slow, 7:33, and final half mile was faster, 7:18). The second rep I averaged a 7:20, which was the top pace boundary called for by the workout plan. So overall close.

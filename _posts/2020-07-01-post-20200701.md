## Run Summary

## Notes

Got myself to bed a bit earlier and woke up and started this run earlier as well. Start time was 7:40 am. My legs felt heavy on this one. It was tough just to get them moving at the speed I wanted to go at. So this was a slower run than my last 6 miler, but also the day after a pretty tough workout. I also don't want to push too hard on these "easy" runs because I know I have hard and longer ones coming up on Friday and Saturday.

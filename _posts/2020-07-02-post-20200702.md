## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        | Temp  |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|  5.42 mi   |    51:43               |  9:32 / mi  |  70   |

## Notes

My legs felt very tired and heavy on this run and my time / pace shows it. The previous day I did 50 squats after my run so I think I might be feeling that in my quads. I went to sleep later than I have been this week. I got a later start on the run (8:15am) and the temperature was higher (70). Maybe I'm still recovering from the tempo run on Tuesday. Maybe I'm holding back in anticipation of the next two days of tough workouts. Still, this feels like the wrong direction and I need to get more comfortable doing these at 8:45 where that pace feels relaxing.

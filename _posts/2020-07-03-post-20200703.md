## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time          	| Pace        | Temp  |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|  7.00 mi   |    56:20               |  8:02 / mi  |  66   |

## Notes

I was a little worried going into this mornings steady state because Tuesday felt really hard and Wednesday / Thursday easy miles were slower than the past few weeks. I also did some body weight squats on Wednesday so this morning my quads were feeling sore. But, I managed to keep it under 7:40 for 5 miles today. It's great hitting the workout numbers.

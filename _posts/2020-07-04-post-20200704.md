## Notes

It was very warm out there today. The last time I did this 12 mile run was on 6/20 and my pace was 8:47. I am guessing the weather was a little cooler, but I don't have that recorded. Also yesterday's steady state workout was much tougher than the downhill repeats I did on 6/19. Overall, I'm pretty happy with how I held up in this run after a week with a lot of tough running. I finished the second half much faster than I ran the first half - keeping it 9 min per mile or less on the way back. I also again brought a camelbak (I don't fill it all the way to save on weight) and for the first time in a while some Strawberry Gu Chews. The flavor was fine. I took a block every few miles, though I did drop one block at mile 7 or 8 I think. Looking forward to some rest tomorrow, but I feel like I accomplished another good week of running.

## Notes

I'm really proud of this workout. I kept it really consistent each of the six half mile reps was between 6:33 and 6:37 average pace or 3:15.9 to 3:18.6. I took the .25 mile recovery very easy. Most of them I walked 1/4 to 2/3 of the recovery distance. One thing that kept me motivated was thinking about how if I failed to come in below 6:40 on the current rep, it would break my streak of good reps and I'd be dissapointed. So the unwillingness to be dissapointed helped me keep pushing. Another piece that helped was going to bed just after 10 and getting an earlier start on the workout. Even so, this was in 76 degree heat. I also didn't have any alcohol the night before this run for what that is worth.

It's about four hours since I finished the workout and I definitely feel like I did a big boy workout.

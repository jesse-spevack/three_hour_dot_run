## Notes

This is two weeks since I rolled my ankle. Maybe that had more of an affect on me that I originally thought, but based on this performance it feels like I'm back to pre ankle roll pacing. This is just 2 seconds per mile slower my best 5 mile easy run on this route.

I didn't go to sleep as early as I should have and I did do some dallying before the run. But after the run I just thought, 'wow, running is such a blessing.'

Continuing to feel strong.

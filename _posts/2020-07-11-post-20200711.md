## Notes

I felt stong throughout this run. I wanted to keep in close to a 9 min pace for the first half of this run. Then my plan was to speed it up on the way back depending on how I felt. I stuck with this and my last mile was my fastest mile.

I brought water in my camelbak and also had a Cliff Bloks Cran-Razz. These were similar to the Gu chews I had in last weeks run. I don't think I have a clear preference between them, yet.

Also wore spf 100 spray on sun screen. It was hot out there.

The following day I was pretty tired and hungry so I indulged in an afternoon nap as well as three larger meals.

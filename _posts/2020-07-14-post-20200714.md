## Notes

Another good workout. The goal here was:

```
2 mile warm up
10 minutes @ 7:30 pace
2 minute jog
8 minutes @ 7:15 pace
2 minute jog
6 minutes @ 7:00
Cool down
```

I was able to do the first rep at 7:26, the second rep at 7:12, and then the final rep at 6:51. I definitely had some more gas in the tank at the end of this workout. The mileage was a bit long because I was on an out and back course and didn't want to turn around in the middle of the second rep. I started this about an hour earlier than I normally run and the temperature was much more tolerable. I'll try to repeat this for the long run on Saturday. Also, I turned off the autolap feature on my garmin watch, which made it easier to track the run.

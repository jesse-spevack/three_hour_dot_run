## Notes

I experienced some discomfort and tightness in my right calf and achilles. A few times during recovery job I stopped entirely to stretch it out. Overall, the 6:40 pace felt sustainable at this distance and I think I had more in the tank at the end of this workout. Tought workout mentally though. Just a lot of repeats.

## Run Summary

| Distance   | Moving Time            | Pace        | Temp  |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|-------|
|  8.00 mi   |  1:06:30               |  8:18 / mi  |  73   |

## Notes

This was a tough workout. I hit the first two reps nicely. But, I think I didn't push myself hard enough in the middle of the final 10 minute rep. As a result I missed the 7 min / mile pace goal by a second or so.

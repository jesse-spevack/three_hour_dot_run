## Run Summary

**46.4 miles - 6h 40m**

## Notes

This was a tough week. My recovery run on Monday was pretty slow (8:59) which I attribute to heat and just still need to recover from the Saturday 16 mile long run. On Tuesday I had a successful fartlek workout. I came in 2 seconds slow on the last repeat. Wednesday was another slow (8:53) recovery run. Thursday I was able to get my comfortable pace back up in the 8:45 range on my five mile recovery run (8:42). But, Friday was slower than I would have liked - 7 miles at 8:53. I think again this is just the result of being in the thick of training, but if it does not pick back up this coming week I'll have to revisit diet and sleep. Saturday's long run was short in distance - only 14 miles. But, the middle 6 miles were at 7:50, 7:51, 7:49, 7:48, 7:48, and 7:40 respectively. So that's pretty consistent and a strong finish. I also was able to do two recovery miles at 9:15 and 9:13 and then finish the wrong strong with two final miles at 8:48 and then 8:31.

I spoke with my coach who says my A goal for the Boulderthon is 3:10, B goal is 3:20, and C goal is 3:30. 3:10 sounds pretty aggressive, but I still have a few weeks. I think 3:30 is very reasonable based on my training so far.
